### What’s Changed

- _Single Source of Truth_: you just set values via environment variable and no changes required! Everything adaps automatically;
- _No CSS-in-JS_: the repository does not have any reason to adopt such the approach;

You can also refer the previous commits to understand what changes I made.

- _GitHub_ Pages: you are able to deploy the artifact to GitHub Pages and share it with the world.

### What’s Deleted
